# Galerkin Method of Moments (Galerkin_MoM)

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Galerkin Method of Moments for microstrip line analysis. The Galerkin method uses rectangular pulse basis functions with Galerkin testing to solve electromagnetic problems.

## Features
- **Galerkin Implementation**: Uses Galerkin testing with rectangular pulse basis functions
- **Convergence Analysis**: Detailed analysis of convergence with increasing N values
- **Empirical Comparison**: Comparison with empirical formulas from Notaros textbook
- **Method Comparison**: Direct comparison with Point Matching method
- **Surface Charge Distribution**: Visualization of charge distribution patterns
